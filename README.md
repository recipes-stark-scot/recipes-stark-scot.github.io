# recipes-stark-scot.github.io
Web pages for [`recipes.stark.scot`](https://recipes.stark.scot) site. However, for the moment that has to remain on Mr Pump because it's the primary site on the Wordpress Multisite installation there, and cannot be changed until I decommission that multisite entirely. For now, then, this version is being served at [`food.stark.scot`](https://food.stark.scot).

The pages themselves are a static copy of a [Local](https://localwp.com) wordpress site.
